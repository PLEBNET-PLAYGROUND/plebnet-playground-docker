# Plebnet Playground Sandbox Docker Package
[![plebnet-playground](https://github.com/PLEBNET-PLAYGROUND/plebnet-playground-docker/actions/workflows/plebnet-playground.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/PLEBNET-PLAYGROUND/plebnet-playground-docker/actions/workflows/plebnet-playground.yml)

This package will setup a bitcoind, lnd, and tor daemon that will connect to the Plebnet Playground Sandbox (Signet) Chain. This allows users to use and test bitcoin and lightning technologies without the financial risk involved with running on the mainnet chain. RTL (Ride The Lightning) and ThunderHub Web UI is also include to provide a more user friendly experience.

## Notes
***
- Package currently on works/tested on x64 Linux (Ubuntu specifically)
- All data for containers are bind mapped into ```volumes/``` directory inside the clone repo for ease of editing them.
- Bitcoind is not using tor, simply because it takes much longer to sync the chain, and while testing this slows me down. The playground signet chain is only around 1MB at time of writing, and takes my machine ~15 seconds to be fully synced clearnet, via tor it is taking minutes.
- You will need to setup LND wallet from scratch, instructions below
- PM [@xenonfun](https://t.me/xenonfun) on Telegram to get access to the Plebnet Playground Telegram group
- All ports are completely exposed to local host, this is mostly to make it easy for end-users to tinker, and as the signet coins in the playground are worthless so there is little risk of hacking. You can modify the ```docker-compose.yaml``` should these cause conflicts.
- For Windows users you will need to use something like git bash until we make some powershell scripts to provide cleaner functionality

## Your first playground LND wallet
***

The wallet will automatically be made for you and use the default password  is ```12345678```
You can change the password with the ```change-password-playground``` alias. If you do change your password make sure to update the ```unlock.password``` file with your new password.

 
## Make your first peer with the seed node for Plebnet Playground Signet
***
- ```connect-playground```
- Now you should get some gossip about the network and be able to run something like this ```lncli describegraph | jq .nodes[] | grep "alias"``` and see a list of the various node aliases on the network
- FYI, your alias is not set in default configuration to avoid confusion, go ahead and edit your ```lnd.conf``` and make an ```alias=YourNewAliasName``` parameter and restart the container.
- Get into the telegram group and ask for some playground signet coins and go wild.

## Get some coins
Install requirements ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```
Run the ```./getcoins.py``` script and you will get 1tBTC put into your lightning on-chain wallet.

## RTL Setup
***
- RTL will at ```http://localhost:3000```, the default password is ```password``` and it will ask you to change this on first login.

## ThunderHub Setup
***
- ThunderHub will at at ```http://localhost:3001```, the default password is ```password```. You can change that by editing the ```volumes/thub_datadir/thubConfig.yaml```. Change `masterPassword: thunderhub-$2a$12$oRzmFZSOmvYv1heHkU053uv0a1tX9MXNqmcMpZs2hQ0t8k1Onnk1a` to `masterPassword: mynewpassword`. Then restart thunderhub using alias `restart-thub`. The masterPassword entry should automatically be converted to the hashed version of the password.

## How to setup Balance of Satoshis (BOS)
***

You may install bos only **after** you have generated an lnd wallet with `create-lnd-wallet`.

```console
sudo python3 ./install_bos.py
```
If you created the bos alias above, you should be good to go

```console
bos --version
10.9.2
```

## How to setup plebnet dashboard

The interactive dashboard is an experimental visualization engine for viewing the lightning network.
If you used the `docker-compose up -d` command above, then the dashboard will run on http://localhost:8050

By default only the playground nodes are visualized. However, you can also visualize real lightning network data by placing a `describegraph.json` file in the repo's `dashboard/` directory, then restart the dashboard setting environment variable `USE_TEST_DATA=TRUE`:

```console
USE_TEST_DATA=TRUE docker-compose up dashboard
```

## How to setup hourly-lightning

Hourly is a git-based time-tracking tool for freelancers with instant invoicing over lightning.
You can install just the hourly service like so:

```sh
TRIPLET=x86_64-linux-gnu services=hourly ./install.sh   
```

For developers, set the environment variable `HOURLY_PATH=/path/to/hourly/repo` prior to running the above command.

For all other users, set the following environment variables (or put them in a `.env` at the base of the plebnet-playground repo):

```sh
# HOURLY_PATH=/path/to/hourly/repo (tabconf_hackathon branch) # uncomment for dev only
HOURLY_WORKPATH=/path/to/your/git/repo
GIT_USER_NAME='YourFirstName YourLastName'
GIT_USER_EMAIL=your_email@some_domain.com
HOURLY_QR_LOGO=https://url_to_your_company_logo
```

Now run hourly:

```sh
docker compose up hourly
```

This will mount your git repo into hourly's container. While under development, a jupyter notebook will be running - copy the jupyter notebook token from the terminal and navigate to localhost:8088, where you can open `dashboard.py`, execute the cells therein and the dashboard should be visible on localhost:8052
