# Reverse Proxy Setup Guide

It is recommended to run `nostr-rs-relay` behind a reverse proxy such
as `haproxy` or `nginx` to provide TLS termination.  Simple examples
of `haproxy` and `nginx` configurations are documented here.

## Minimal HAProxy Configuration

Assumptions:

* HAProxy version is `2.4.10` or greater (older versions not tested).
* Hostname for the relay is `relay.example.com`.
* Your relay should be available over wss://relay.example.com
* Your (NIP-11) relay info page should be available on https://relay.example.com
* SSL certificate is located in `/etc/certs/example.com.pem`.
* Relay is running on port 8080.
* Limit connections to 400 concurrent.
* HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) is desired.
* Only TLS 1.2 or greater is allowed.

```

### HAProxy Notes

You may experience WebSocket connection problems with Firefox if
HTTP/2 is enabled, for older versions of HAProxy (2.3.x).  Either
disable HTTP/2 (`h2`), or upgrade HAProxy.

## Bare-bones Nginx Configuration

Assumptions:

* `Nginx` version is `1.18.0` (other versions not tested).
* Hostname for the relay is `relay.example.com`.
* SSL certificate and key are located at `/etc/letsencrypt/live/relay.example.com/`.
* Relay is running on port `8080`.

```
http {
    server {
        listen 443 ssl;
        server_name relay.example.com;
        ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/relay.example.com/fullchain.pem;
        ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/relay.example.com/privkey.pem;
        ssl_protocols TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;
        ssl_ciphers HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5;
        keepalive_timeout 70;

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
            proxy_http_version 1.1;
            proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
            proxy_set_header Connection "Upgrade";
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
        }
    }
}
```

### Nginx Notes

The above configuration was tested on `nginx` `1.18.0` was tested on `Ubuntu 20.04`.

For help installing `nginx` on `Ubuntu`, see [this guide](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-nginx-on-ubuntu-20-04).

For guidance on using `letsencrypt` to obtain a cert on `Ubuntu`, including an `nginx` plugin, see [this post](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-secure-nginx-with-let-s-encrypt-on-ubuntu-20-04).
